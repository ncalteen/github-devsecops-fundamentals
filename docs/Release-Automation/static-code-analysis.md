# Static Code Analysis

As the final step of this lab, you are going to integrate GitHub Advanced
Security (GHAS) into your CI/CD pipeline. GHAS uses CodeQL static analysis to
detect potential security vulnerabilities in a project. Combined with automation
using GitHub Actions, GHAS can provide fast notification of vulnerabilities and
potential remediation steps.

> [!NOTE]
>
> GHAS requires additional licensing! If you are running this lab in a
> company-managed GitHub account, you may not be able to complete this step.
